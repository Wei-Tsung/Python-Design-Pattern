# So what's Design Pattern?

- A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. 

- It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. 


- It also gives implementation hints and examples. The solution is a general arrangement of objects and classes that solve the problem. The solution is customized and implemented to solve the problem in a particular context.
